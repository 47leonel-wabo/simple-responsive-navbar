# Responsive `navbar`

## Using `react-router-dom v6`

* BrowserRouter
* Routes (which replaces `Switch` in previous version)
* Route (which now use `element` which takes an element, rather than reference in `component` for previous version)
* Navigate (replace `Redirect` in previous version)
* Link
* NavLink (has `end` attribute for strict path match, and `activeClassName` and `activeStyle` for highlighting active state)
* Nested routes with `Outlet`
* useNavigate() replaces `history.push('/path')` in previous version
